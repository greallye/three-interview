# THREEJS INTERVIEW TEST
## _Create a exploded 3D model view_

Create simple threejs web page, which loads a GLTF file 3D model into the page. The page must have orbit camera controls. Add a button to the page which allows the 3D model to be exploded out from the center of the object to create a CAD exploded view of the model. 


## STEPS
- [THREEJS](https://threejs.org/) Use the Three.js libary
